List of items that need to be completed:

- Remove:
    - Need to remove secondary index data
    - Decide if we should implement remove in lua or not. We may be able to get away with just pipelining it to the server as an atomic op.
- Indexing:
    - For an existing collection, how do we add a new index and then populate the index? Do we block all other ops in order to safely create the index? If so, how long will that take on say a collection with 1M documents? Need to benchmark.
    - For numeric and date fields, store the data as the score and set the member to the id.
- All queries:
    - Implement '$and' queries: i.e. { userActivated: true, createdAt: { $gt, dateYesterdayMidnight }}
    - Implement $lt, $lte, $gt, $gte
    - Implement $in
    - Implement $or
    - Much Lower priority:
        - Embedded document queries
        - Exact array match
        - Match array element
        - Match specific element of array
- Implement EVALSHA
- Move schema into it's own npm?
- Implement MessagePack?
